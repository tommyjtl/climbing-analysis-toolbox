# Climbing Analysis Toolbox 

A set of computer vision tools for analyzing your climbing videos.

## Getting Started

```shell
# (Optional) Create an virtual env
python -m venv PATH_TO_YOUR_ENV
source PATH_TO_YOUR_ENV
```

```bash
# Install prerequisites
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Warping Video for Scene Matching

> To be edited.

### Drawing Trajectories for Body Movements

> It is recommended to apply this script to a video with fixed camera position, i.e., no one's holding the camera.

There is a couple of settings you can adjust inside the script for `extract_pose_and_draw_trajectory()`:

| Argument | Description | 
| - | - |
| `track_point`  | Points of interest on the estimated pose you want to track. A velocity vector arrow will be drawn to indicate how fast each point is moving with respect to its 3D position |
| `overlay_trajectory`  | Whether to overlay a half-transparent mask on top of the original video. Note that if this is set to `True`, the velocity vector arrow that corresponds to each track point will be removed. |
| `draw_pose`  | Whether to draw pose skeleton or not |
| `kalman_settings`  | Whether to apply Kalman filter to smooth out the trajectory (not the pose itself) |
| `trajectory_png_path`  | Whether to generate a `.png` file for the trajectory with black background |

Then, run the command as follows:

```shell
python tools/body_trajectory.py --video_path \
    "../videos/IMG_1915_converted.mp4"
```

The generated video will then be located inside of the `output` folder. An example generated video can be found [here](./examples/pose_trajectory_IMG_2862_converted.mp4)
